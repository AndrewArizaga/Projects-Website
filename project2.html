        <h3>Project Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            Recently, I got locked out of my house because, let’s be honest, I’m not the most alert person when waking up for my morning classes. Misplacing my keys or forgetting to grab them as I rush out the door has happened way too often. That’s when I thought: what if the door just recognized me and let me in?
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to build something that combines convenience and security—a door that knows your face, listens to your voice, and unlocks itself without the hassle of keys or passcodes. This project is my way of solving a frustrating problem while exploring how technology can make everyday life easier and more secure.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This project integrates advanced face and voice recognition technologies with a door automation system. The goal is to eliminate the need for physical keys or passcodes by implementing a secure and user-friendly system that recognizes authorized individuals based on biometric data.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Biometric authentication using face and voice recognition</li>
            <li>Automatic door unlocking for authorized individuals</li>
            <li>High-security encryption for stored biometric data</li>
            <li>Fallback options such as a manual override or keypad entry</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skills Applied</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine learning for facial and voice recognition</li>
            <li>IoT integration and automation</li>
            <li>Embedded systems programming</li>
            <li>Data encryption and cybersecurity</li>
        </ul>
