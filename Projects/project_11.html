                An <strong>Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)</strong> is an essential component in modern electronics, responsible for converting 
                continuous analog signals (such as voltages, sound waves, or temperatures) into discrete digital signals that can be processed 
                by computers or microcontrollers. ADCs bridge the gap between the physical world and digital systems, enabling applications like

                balance of speed, resolution, and power consumption. SAR ADCs work through an iterative process, using a binary search algorithm 
                to narrow down the input signal’s value step by step. Each step compares the input signal to a reference voltage, 
                gradually refining the digital output. This makes SAR ADCs particularly suited for low-power, high-precision applications

                power-consuming circuitry. The VTC's ability to work with a small input range makes it a critical component for improving

        <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>

        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <div class="how-it-works-paragraph">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Step 1: Analog Input Signal</h3>
            <img src="../Project_Images/analog-input-signal.png" alt="Analog Input Signal" class="how-it-works-image left-aligned">
            <p>
                The ADC begins with the reception of an analog signal, typically ranging from <strong>0–400 mV</strong>, from sources such as biomedical sensors or IoT devices. These signals represent real-world data, such as heart rate, temperature, or voltage levels. 
                To ensure the signal is suitable for digitization:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>front-end circuit</strong> amplifies the input signal to make it detectable by the ADC.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtering</strong> removes noise, ensuring the signal remains clean and accurate.</li>
                <li>The signal is <strong>level-shifted</strong> if needed to align with the ADC’s input range.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This preprocessing step ensures the analog signal is clean, strong, and ready for precise digitization.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <div class="how-it-works-paragraph">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Step 2: Coarse Digitization with SAR ADC</h3>
            <img src="../Project_Images/sar-adc.png" alt="Coarse Digitization with SAR ADC" class="how-it-works-image right-aligned">
            <p>
                The <strong>6-bit SAR ADC</strong> is the first major stage of digitization. It performs a coarse approximation of the analog input signal using a <strong>successive approximation algorithm</strong>. The process involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>comparator</strong> evaluating whether the input voltage is higher or lower than a reference voltage.</li>
                <li>Iterative adjustments via a <strong>binary search algorithm</strong> to refine the approximation.</li>
                <li>A built-in <strong>Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)</strong> converting each digital guess back to analog for comparison.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By the end of this process, the SAR ADC generates a <strong>6-bit digital code</strong> representing the input signal and produces a <strong>residual voltage</strong> containing the finer details for further refinement.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <div class="how-it-works-paragraph">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Step 3: Residual Voltage</h3>
            <img src="../Project_Images/residual-voltage.png" alt="Residual Voltage" class="how-it-works-image left-aligned">
            <p>
                The residual voltage, representing the difference between the input signal and the SAR ADC’s 6-bit approximation, is a crucial intermediate signal. It retains the finer details of the original input signal and ensures that the ADC can achieve its full <strong>10-bit resolution</strong>. This signal is passed to the <strong>Voltage-to-Time Converter (VTC)</strong> for further processing.
            </p>

            <img src="../Project_Images/vtc.png" alt="Voltage-to-Time Conversion" class="how-it-works-image right-aligned">
            <p>
                In the Voltage-to-Time Conversion stage, the residual voltage is translated into a time delay, a format that allows for high precision in the subsequent stage. 
                This process works as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The residual voltage controls a <strong>timing circuit</strong>, which generates a time delay proportional to the voltage magnitude.</li>
                <li><strong>Smaller voltages</strong> produce <strong>shorter delays</strong>, while <strong>larger voltages</strong> result in <strong>longer delays</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The VTC ensures excellent linearity, making the time-domain signal ready for digitization by the Vernier TDC.
            </p>

        <div class="how-it-works-paragraph">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Step 5: Fine Digitization with Vernier TDC</h3>
            <img src="../Project_Images/vernier-tdc.png" alt="Vernier TDC" class="how-it-works-image left-aligned">
            <p>
                The <strong>4-bit Vernier Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC)</strong> processes the time delay from the VTC and converts it into a fine-resolution digital value. The TDC operates using two delay lines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>fast delay line</strong> with shorter intervals.</li>
                <li>A <strong>slow delay line</strong> with slightly longer intervals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By measuring the time difference between these delay lines with sub-nanosecond precision, the TDC generates a <strong>4-bit digital code</strong>, capturing the fine details of the signal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 6 -->
        <div class="how-it-works-paragraph">

            <p>
                Finally, the outputs from the SAR ADC and Vernier TDC are combined to form a <strong>10-bit digital code</strong>. The 6-bit SAR ADC output provides a coarse approximation, while the 4-bit TDC output refines the result by adding finer details.
            </p>
            <p>
                This high-resolution digital signal is sent to a microcontroller or processing system for further use, such as real-time analysis or data logging. The hybrid architecture ensures high precision and low power consumption, making this ADC suitable for modern applications.

        <!-- Challenge 1 -->
        <div class="challenge-paragraph">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Challenge 1: Achieving High Precision at Low Power</h3>
            <img src="../Project_Images/precision-vs-power.png" alt="Precision vs Power" class="challenge-image left-aligned">
            <p>
                One of the primary challenges in designing this ADC was maintaining high precision (10-bit resolution) without exceeding strict power consumption limits. Precision often requires amplifiers and comparators with higher transconductance, which increases power usage.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A hybrid SAR ADC architecture was employed, combining a voltage-mode SAR ADC for coarse approximation and a time-based Vernier TDC for fine resolution. This reduced the power demands on the SAR ADC while leveraging the efficiency of time-based processing in the VTC and TDC stages.</p>

            <img src="../Project_Images/noise-reduction.png" alt="Noise Management" class="challenge-image right-aligned">
            <p>
                Noise from external sources, such as power supply fluctuations and electromagnetic interference, posed a significant obstacle to achieving accurate signal conversion. Unfiltered noise could degrade both coarse and fine digitization.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Advanced filtering techniques were implemented in the front-end circuit to remove unwanted noise before digitization. Additionally, the design incorporated shielding and careful layout practices during the silicon implementation to minimize susceptibility to interference.</p>

            <p>
                The Voltage-to-Time Converter (VTC) needed to exhibit a highly linear relationship between input voltage and time delay. Non-linearity in this stage could significantly degrade the ADC’s overall performance and resolution.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A carefully designed current-controlled delay line was used, ensuring a linear response over the entire input range. Rigorous simulations and fine-tuning of the VTC parameters helped optimize linearity.</p>

            <p>
                The accuracy of the Vernier TDC depends on the precise calibration of its fast and slow delay lines. Even minor mismatches could lead to significant errors in time measurement.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A robust calibration routine was implemented to minimize mismatch between the delay lines. The design also included self-tuning mechanisms to adjust for variations caused by temperature or process changes.</p>
