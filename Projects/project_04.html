                <p>
                    This project was born out of the need to address challenges in power system analysis, particularly for radial distribution networks. These networks, while widely used in urban and residential areas, often face issues such as voltage drops, inefficiencies, and fault sensitivity. By developing this tool, I aimed to provide a practical, scalable, and user-friendly solution for engineers and researchers working to optimize power grids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tool’s design reflects my passion for creating impactful engineering solutions that are both technically robust and accessible. It bridges the gap between academic theory and real-world application, ensuring that engineers have the resources they need to innovate and improve power systems.

                The <strong>Radial Distribution Network Diagram</strong> visually represents how electricity flows through a system. Starting from the substation, power is distributed outward like branches of a tree, reaching residential, commercial, and industrial loads. As power moves further from the source, voltage levels naturally drop—a critical challenge this tool addresses. By iterating through each branch, the tool ensures voltage stability and optimizes distribution to prevent losses and inefficiencies.
