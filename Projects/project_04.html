        <!-- Step 1: Input System Data -->
        <div class="how-it-works-paragraph">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Step 1: Input System Data</h3>
            <img src="../Project_Images/Project_04_input_data.png" alt="Input Data Overview" class="how-it-works-image left-aligned">
            <p>
                The tool begins by importing power system data structured in IEEE format. Data such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Node identifiers and voltage levels.</li>
                    <li>Active and reactive power demands at each load.</li>
                    <li>Line impedances and the Y-bus admittance matrix.</li>
                </ul>
                are read from Excel spreadsheets. The modular design ensures compatibility with radial systems of varying sizes and complexities.
            </p>
        </div>

            <img src="../Project_Images/Project_04_radial_model.png" alt="Radial Network Model" class="how-it-works-image right-aligned">
            <p>
                The system topology is mapped into a directed graph using adjacency lists, capturing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Connections between nodes.</li>
                    <li>Branch lengths and impedances.</li>
                    <li>Shunt capacitance and distributed generation data.</li>
                </ul>
                This graph-based representation forms the basis for iterative calculations and ensures efficient traversal during sweeps.

            <p>
                The backward sweep propagates from the terminal nodes back to the slack bus, performing calculations for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Real and reactive power flows on each branch.</li>
                    <li>Current injections at each node, considering local loads and shunt elements.</li>
                    <li>Total line losses by summing branch-wise contributions.</li>
                </ul>
                This sweep ensures that upstream current distributions reflect all downstream load requirements.

            <p>
                The forward sweep recalculates node voltages moving from the slack bus to the terminal nodes. Using:
                <ul>
                    <li>Branch current values from the backward sweep.</li>
                    <li>Known branch impedances.</li>
                    <li>Voltage at the previous node (starting from the source).</li>
                </ul>
                Voltage drops are iteratively corrected, ensuring accuracy across all nodes.

            <p>
                Backward and forward sweeps are repeated until the following convergence criteria are met:
                <ul>
                    <li>Node voltage variations fall below a predefined tolerance (e.g., 0.01%).</li>
                    <li>Line current variations stabilize across iterations.</li>
                    <li>Power losses converge to a consistent value.</li>
                </ul>
                These conditions ensure numerical stability and accuracy in the final results.

        <!-- Challenge 1 -->
        <div class="challenge">
            <h4>Handling Large Datasets</h4>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Processing large-scale radial distribution networks required managing thousands of nodes and branches without compromising performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Memory-efficient algorithms were implemented, leveraging Python’s NumPy and Pandas libraries for optimized data manipulation. Parallel processing techniques were explored to enhance computational speed.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Challenge 2 -->
        <div class="challenge">
            <h4>Ensuring IEEE Compliance</h4>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The input and output data formats needed to align with IEEE standards, which posed challenges in parsing and writing complex datasets while maintaining accuracy.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A custom parser was developed to interpret IEEE-compliant formats, and robust validation scripts were written to ensure all outputs adhered strictly to these standards.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Challenge 3 -->
        <div class="challenge">
            <h4>Iterative Convergence in the Algorithm</h4>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The Ladder Iterative Method relies on iterative computations, which can fail to converge in poorly conditioned systems or when initial guesses are far from the solution.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A dynamic error-tolerance mechanism was implemented, adjusting iteration parameters based on system conditions to ensure reliable convergence. Logging was added to track iterations and identify issues dynamically.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Challenge 4 -->
        <div class="challenge">
            <h4>Voltage Stability Analysis</h4>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Accurately calculating voltage levels across all nodes, while accounting for system losses, required careful calibration of the algorithm.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Advanced numerical methods, including backward and forward sweeps, were optimized to ensure precise voltage and current calculations. Tools like Matplotlib were used to visualize results and fine-tune the model.</p>
