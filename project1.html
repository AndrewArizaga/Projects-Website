    <h3>Project Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        I’ve always thought that unlocking doors with keys or passcodes feels a little outdated. I mean, how many times have I misplaced my keys or forgotten a passcode when I needed to get in? That got me thinking: why not create a door that recognizes you—your face, your voice—and lets you in automatically?
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was inspired by the idea of combining security with convenience. By integrating face and voice recognition into an automated system, I wanted to explore how we can make everyday tasks seamless while keeping security at the forefront. It’s about creating something practical and innovative that could be used at home, in offices, or even in secure facilities.
