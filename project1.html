        <h3>Project Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            I’ll be honest—I have a bad habit of leaving lights on when I leave a room. Lately, as I get older, I’ve been trying to be more mindful and frugal, especially when it comes to things like my energy bill. As an engineer, I figured, why not build something that helps me solve this problem?
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to create a system that’s not just cool to build but actually useful—something that can help people save energy without even thinking about it. Combining microcontrollers and sensors felt like the perfect way to build something practical, affordable, and actually useful for managing energy at home.

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This project leverages a microcontroller and various sensors to monitor and optimize energy consumption in a residential setting. By integrating hardware components with efficient software, the system detects when rooms are unoccupied and automatically turns off lights or appliances, thereby conserving energy.
