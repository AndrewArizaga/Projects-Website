        <h3>Project Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            Energy consumption is something we rarely think about until the bill arrives—and let’s be honest, it’s not always easy to figure out where all that energy is going. That got me wondering: what if there was a way to not only track energy use in real time but also predict future usage patterns and detect inefficiencies before they cost you money?
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is my attempt to combine machine learning with real-time energy monitoring to create a system that’s smarter about energy usage. By analyzing patterns and spotting anomalies, the goal is to make managing energy easier and more proactive. It’s about bridging technology and everyday life to tackle a problem we all face but rarely see.

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This project integrates machine learning algorithms with energy monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into energy consumption. By using predictive models, the system can forecast future energy usage, identify inefficiencies, and suggest actionable steps to optimize energy consumption.
