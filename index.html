        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>I am an Electrical Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), currently in my second year, pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. My academic journey includes research initiatives, such as leveraging advanced mathematics to enhance engineering education, alongside coursework in Digital Systems Design, Electric Networks, and Embedded Systems.</p>
            <p>My professional experience spans various roles, including serving as an Energy Management Engineering Intern at the City of Brampton, where I contributed to sustainable energy solutions, and as a Hardware Engineering Intern at Cence Power, focusing on power electronics and embedded systems. Additionally, I worked as a Computer Repair Technician at Imported Brands of Canada, collaborating with renowned brands such as Apple, Lenovo, and Windows systems.</p>
            <p>I am open to new opportunities, particularly for Summer 2025, where I aim to apply my skills in innovative engineering projects. I am passionate about sustainability, renewable energy, and leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges. Please feel free to connect to discuss potential collaborations or roles!</p>
